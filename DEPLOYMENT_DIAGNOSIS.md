# Deployment Diagnosis & Fix Plan

## Summary
**The GitHub Actions deployment workflow has NEVER worked.** It was added recently but requires AWS secrets that were never configured in the GitHub repository.

## Historical Context

### Timeline of Deployment Infrastructure

1. **Early deployment**: Used local scripts (`scripts/deploy.sh`)
2. **September 2024** (commit e8efb61): Added `ops/deploy.sh` - a comprehensive local deployment script
3. **October 2024** (commit 8197ca8): Added `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow
4. **Current state**: GitHub Actions workflow has 0 successful runs out of 100+ attempts

### The Real Deployment Method

Throughout this conversation, deployments were done **manually** using:

```bash
# Local deployment script
npm run deploy:local
# or
bash ops/deploy.sh --env-file ./.secrets/.env.local
```

This script:
- Builds Docker images locally
- Runs preflight checks
- Deploys via `docker compose`
- Runs migrations and seeds
- Performs health checks

## Root Causes of Deployment Failures

### 1. Missing GitHub Secrets

The `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` requires these secrets (currently **ALL MISSING**):

```yaml
secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID       # ❌ NOT SET
secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY   # ❌ NOT SET
secrets.AWS_REGION              # ❌ NOT SET
secrets.ECR_REPOSITORY          # ❌ NOT SET
secrets.EC2_HOST                # ❌ NOT SET
secrets.EC2_USER                # ❌ NOT SET
secrets.EC2_SSH_KEY             # ❌ NOT SET
secrets.EC2_WORKDIR             # ❌ NOT SET
```

**Verification**: Running `gh secret list` returns empty.

### 2. Pre-existing Linter Errors

The workflow's quality-gates job fails on:
```bash
npm run lint
```

These are TypeScript errors that exist in the codebase but are currently bypassed in local development.

### 3. Workflow Was Never Tested

The workflow was added aspirationally but:
- No secrets were ever configured
- No successful deployment has occurred
- The infrastructure assumes EC2 + ECR setup that may not exist

## Current Workflow Behavior

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│  Push to main       │
└──────────┬──────────┘
           │
           ▼
┌─────────────────────┐
│  quality-gates      │  ← ✅ Runs npm install/lint/test
│  (Lint & Test)      │  ← ❌ FAILS due to TypeScript errors
└──────────┬──────────┘
           │
           ▼
┌─────────────────────┐
│  build-and-push     │  ← ❌ FAILS: Missing AWS_REGION secret
│  (Build & Push)     │  ← Also needs AWS credentials
└──────────┬──────────┘
           │
           ▼
┌─────────────────────┐
│  migrate            │  ← Never reached (needs EC2_SSH_KEY)
│  (Run Migrations)   │
└──────────┬──────────┘
           │
           ▼
┌─────────────────────┐
│  deploy             │  ← Never reached
│  (Deploy App)       │
└─────────────────────┘
```

## Solutions

### Option 1: Fix GitHub Actions (Recommended for Production)

**Required Steps:**

1. **Set up AWS Infrastructure** (if not already done):
   - Create ECR repository for Docker images
   - Set up EC2 instance for deployment
   - Configure IAM user with ECR push permissions
   - Set up SSH key for EC2 access

2. **Configure GitHub Secrets**:
   ```bash
   gh secret set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID --body "your-access-key"
   gh secret set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY --body "your-secret-key"
   gh secret set AWS_REGION --body "us-east-1"
   gh secret set ECR_REPOSITORY --body "clean-portal"
   gh secret set EC2_HOST --body "your-ec2-ip-or-hostname"
   gh secret set EC2_USER --body "ubuntu"
   gh secret set EC2_SSH_KEY --body "$(cat ~/.ssh/your-ec2-key.pem)"
   gh secret set EC2_WORKDIR --body "/home/ubuntu/clean-portal"
   ```

3. **Fix Linter Errors**:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   # Fix all TypeScript errors reported
   ```

4. **Test Deployment**:
   ```bash
   git commit --allow-empty -m "test: trigger deployment"
   git push origin main
   gh run watch
   ```

### Option 2: Use Local Deployment (Current Method)

**This is what you've been doing successfully:**

```bash
# For local development
npm run deploy:local

# For production (with proper .env.production file)
npm run deploy:prod
```

**Pros:**
- Already working
- No GitHub secrets needed
- Full control over deployment process
- Comprehensive validation and health checks

**Cons:**
- Manual process
- Requires local Docker and environment setup
- No automated deployments on push

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach

Use local deployment for now, but gradually migrate to GitHub Actions:

1. **Immediate**: Disable or remove `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
2. **Short-term**: Continue using `ops/deploy.sh` for deployments
3. **Long-term**: Set up AWS infrastructure and configure GitHub Actions properly

## Recommendations

Based on the evidence:

1. **Immediate Action**: Document that deployments are manual via `ops/deploy.sh`
2. **Decision Required**: Do you want automated deployments via GitHub Actions?
   - **YES** → Follow Option 1 (requires AWS setup + GitHub secrets)
   - **NO** → Follow Option 2 (remove/disable deploy.yml workflow)
3. **Fix Linter Errors**: Regardless of deployment method, fix TypeScript errors

## Questions to Answer

1. **Do you have AWS infrastructure set up?**
   - ECR repository?
   - EC2 instance?
   - IAM credentials?

2. **What's your desired deployment workflow?**
   - Automatic on push to main?
   - Manual via local script?
   - Triggered manually via GitHub Actions?

3. **Should we keep the deploy.yml workflow?**
   - If YES: Need to configure all secrets
   - If NO: Remove/disable it to avoid confusion

## Next Steps

**Waiting for your decision on:**
1. Continue with manual deployments (ops/deploy.sh)?
2. Set up GitHub Actions properly (requires AWS secrets)?
3. Remove deploy.yml workflow entirely?

Once you decide, I can implement the appropriate solution.
