# Current Status Summary - October 6, 2025

## 🎯 IMPORTANT: You Have ONE Site, Not Two

**What's Actually Running:**
- **URL:** https://portal.spoot.com
- **Type:** Production site (serving real traffic)
- **Container Names:** Use "-dev" suffix (misleading naming only)
- **Test/Dev Site:** Does NOT exist yet ❌

**Clarification:** The container names have "-dev" in them, but this is **NOT a development environment**. This is your **production site** serving live traffic. Phase 3 will create a separate actual dev environment.

## 🚀 What Happens Next

### Option 1: Add Content to Current Site
If you want to populate the current site with content:
1. Log in to admin panel
2. Create crawlers
3. Configure RSS feeds or web sources
4. Run crawlers to generate posts
5. Content will appear on homepage

### Option 2: Implement Phase 3 (Dev Environment)
To create a separate development environment:
1. Add DNS: `dev.portal.spoot.com` → `44.198.212.206`
2. Deploy using `PHASE3_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
3. You'll then have:
   - **Production:** portal.spoot.com (stable, for users)
   - **Development:** dev.portal.spoot.com (for testing)

## ❓ Questions to Clarify Your Intent

**What would you like me to do next?**

**A.** Help you add content/crawlers to the current site so it has data?

**B.** Proceed with Phase 3 to create the separate dev environment?

**C.** Fix something else that's not working correctly?

Please let me know which direction you'd like to go, and I'll proceed accordingly.

## 📝 Technical Notes

- Site is running in dev mode for hot-reload capability
- Container naming is confusing but doesn't affect functionality  
- Database is healthy but empty by design (fresh install)
- All core features tested and working
- Ready for content or ready for Phase 3 implementation
